# A list of major upgrades and how to migrate

The following is a list of major changes to `bare`. To avoid making the top of this file increasingly irrelevant as time goes on, the upgrades are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Synopsis
- makes bare.sh one big file
- creates `home` directory as opposed to `.var`, `.lib`, and `.etc`
- stops sourcing `~/.barerc`

### Migration tips

1. You'll no longer be able to run scripts from `.var/scripts` directory
2. The `~/.barerc` and `.etc/barerc` and `.lib/barerc` are no longer sourced
3. If you set up an alias for in your `~/.bashrc` (or similar), you'll need to tweak that to `bare.sh` (instead of `bare`)

You can run the following migration script to get those things back into context.

Copy and paste this into your terminal or make it an executable file. Run the script from the root of your `bare.sh` directory.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

{

	mkdir -p home
	for item in scripts recfiles downloads .cache; do
		mkdir -p "home/$item"
	done
	mkdir home/.cache/weather
	for item in document openai; do
		mkdir -p "home/recfiles/$item"
	done
	mkdir home/imports

	touch home/recfiles/document/list.rec
	touch home/recfiles/document/tags.rec
	for item in assistants messages threads; do
		touch home/recfiles/openai/$item.rec
	done

	cp -r .var home/imports/

	{
		mv home/imports/.var/.cache/weather/* home/.cache/weather/ && rm -rf home/imports/.var/.cache
